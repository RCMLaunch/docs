## Tuning and Calibration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tilt Calibration/Tuning">
    Click here for a step-by-step Tilt Tuning guide.

    1. First, we must open the USB Host Inputs dropdown menu.

       <img
         src="/images/image-1.png"
         alt="Image"
         title="Image"
         className="mx-auto"
         style={{ width:"35%" }}
       />
    2. Scroll down to the guitar tilt section. You’ll see this:

       <img
         src="/images/image.png"
         alt="Image"
         title="Image"
         className="mx-auto"
         style={{ width:"69%" }}
       />
    3. Click Calibrate!
    4. Then, position your guitar in the position you play in. Click Next.
    5. After that, tilt your guitar up to the position you would like tilt to activate. Hold it there and click next.
    6. You’re done! Click Save Settings on the left side. After it’s done, give it a try! You can recalibrate it to your liking just by clicking Calibrate again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Whammy Calibration/Tuning">
    1. First, we must open the USB Host Inputs dropdown menu.

       <img
         src="/images/image-3.png"
         alt="Image"
         title="Image"
         className="mx-auto"
         style={{ width:"50%" }}
       />
    2. Scroll down to the guitar whammy section. You’ll see this:

       <img
         src="/images/image-4.png"
         alt="Image"
         title="Image"
         className="mx-auto"
         style={{ width:"88%" }}
       />
    3. Click Calibrate!
    4. Then, don’t touch your whammy bar and then click Next.
    5. After that, push your whammy bar down as far as it can go without overdoing it. Hold it there, then click Next.
    6. Now you have to set Deadzone. Push the whammy bar in a little bit and you can see the value go up a little bit. Look for a point where the whammy won’t activate on it’s own. Hold it there, then click Next.
    7. You’re done! Click Save Settings on the left side. After it’s done, give it a try! You can manually adjust the deadzone with the sliders as well if you’d like to tweak your settings.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My MiniHost Adapter is not appearing in the RCM Programming Tool" icon="sparkles">
    There are multiple potential reasons for this occurring.

    - The instrument plugged into your MiniHost Adapter may be causing the adapter to go into a different mode. Unplug the instrument, then plug the MiniHost adapter back into your computer on its own.
    - Faulty USB port. Try a different one.
    - Lastly, you may just need to hard reset the device. Holding the reset button while plugging the adapter in will put it into recovery mode, which you can then open the [RCM Programming Tool](https://retrocultmods.com/programming-tool/) and erase and reset to factory.

    If you continue to run into issues, send us an email at [support@retrocultmods.com](mailto:support@retrocultmods.com)
