title: "Festival2"

This will put your guitar into keyboard mode, where your inputs will be assigned to the default Fortnite Festival Pro Lead Keyboard settings:

- 1-5 for frets
- Right Ctrl & Right Shift for strum
- Forward Slash (/) for whammy
- Page Down for overdrive

You will know it's working if your instrument changes when you press the frets in the Festival Main Stage Lobby.

Note that you will have to control your menus/character movement with keyboard & mouse/other controller, but once you load into the game from the Festival Main Stage, the guitar will function as intended!\
**Have fun!**
