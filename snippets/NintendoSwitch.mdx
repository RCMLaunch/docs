## Nintendo Switch – Fortnite Festival

NOTE: You will have to switch between two modes while navigating and playing, so be ready to do that often.

**MODE SWITCH BUTTON COMBO:**

# <u>YELLOW + START</u>

_(press and hold yellow first, then tap start once)_

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **You want your Adapter or Zeroboard (PCB) to be on the Default preset.** If you have changed yours to be something different, please download the latest [RCM Programming Tool](https://retrocultmods.com/programming-tool/) and factory reset it back to Default. You will have to calibrate your whammy (and tilt if needed).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Turn on your Nintendo Switch and plug your adapter/guitar in!** It should be able to navigate the NS menu immediately. If not, unplug and replug in the adapter/guitar.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Once you have confirmed that your adapter/guitar is working on the Switch, **open Fortnite Festival.**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Once the game is open, **you should be able to navigate the game with the guitar**, at least somewhat.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open your game settings, then switch to the GAME tab. Scroll to the bottom and **switch the “ALWAYS DISPLAY PRO PARTS” to ON.**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Load into Fortnite Festival Main Stage, then select your songs. **Once you ready up, HOLD YELLOW then tap START**. Your guitar should then function to for play!
  </Step>
  <Step>
    After your song is over, do the YELLOW+START combo again to be able to navigate.
  </Step>
