Flip the controller over so the **Red Octane** sticker on the back of the body is visible. The type of screws used on the outside shells will depend on the model of your guitar:\
**95055/95605 – PH1 Screws**\
**95157.805 – T10 Screws**

    <Danger>
      The screw marked in red is sometimes **longer** than the others; remember this for when you put everything back together!

Ensure that **all** screws are removed, and open the shell.\
\
Once the shell begins to open, slowly move down the rest of the shell until it pops open completely.\
Repeat this process for the neck, using the opening at the neck connector and working towards the headstock.

If the shell seems to gets stuck, **DO NOT FORCE IT**. Check to make sure you have removed **all** of the screws before continuing to pry the shell.

## 2. Removal of Original Parts

Now its time to remove the stock boards that will be replaced with the new boards included in the kit.

      Remove the **2x screws** on the RJ11 port. (This board will not be replaced, so if you’d like to leave it in so there is no open hole in the shell after completing the kit, leave this board installed and cut the wires coming from it instead)
    </Callout>

      Remove the **4x screws** on the stock input board.
