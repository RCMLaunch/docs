# Step-by-Step Installation Guide

## 1. Opening the Guitar

Flip the controller over so the **Red Octane** sticker on the back of the body is visible. The type of screws used on the outside shells will depend on the model of your guitar:\
**95055/95605 – PH1/PH2 Screws**\
**95157.805 – T10 Screws**

Ensure that **all** screws are removed, and open the shell.\
\
Once the shell begins to open, slowly move down the rest of the shell until it pops open completely.\
Repeat this process for the neck, using the opening at the neck connector and working towards the headstock.

If the shell seems to gets stuck, **DO NOT FORCE IT**. Check to make sure you have removed **all** of the screws before continuing to pry the shell.

## 2. Removal of Original Parts

Once all the screws are removed, remove all of the stock boards along with the whammy assembly from the shell.

**You will need to keep the following parts of the whammy assembly:**

## 3. (Optional) Clean Your Guitar

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/btX9tRJN9nk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen />

In this step, I took a little bit of time to clean some parts of the guitar. I suggest being more thorough in your build, as your guitar may have finger grime from way back in the day!

A bit of rubbing alcohol and/or soap and water can go a long way. Make sure the parts are fully dry if you clean with soap and water.

Pro tip: Toothbrush, Dawn soap, and water.

## 4. Test Your Revival Kit

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9KKaXZ-08fA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen />

Before installing the Revival Zeroboard/Strumboard and Revival Fretboard, they should be tested for proper functionality.

<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    Plug the Revival Fretboard into the Revival Zeroboard/Strumboard using the three included white cables. Make sure that each connection goes to the proper port. It is suggested to go one by one while installing.

</Steps>

## 5. Prepping the New Strumbar (RGB Only)

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7L-NX8Dt0oU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen />

**IF YOU DID NOT ORDER THE 3D PRINTED CLEAR STRUM BAR, SKIP THIS STEP.**

Before installing the new Strumboard, we need to transfer some pieces of the stock strumbar over to the new one:

<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    Remove the metal strumrod by pulling it out of the stock strumbar.

    <img
      src="/images/rgbstrumbar1.png"
      alt="Rgbstrumbar1"
      title="Rgbstrumbar1"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"33%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Remove both of the circular spacers on each end of the strumbar. You can easily remove these by pushing them out with your finger from the inside of the strumbar.

    <img
      src="/images/rgbstrumbar2.png"
      alt="Rgbstrumbar2"
      title="Rgbstrumbar2"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"30%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Remove the four rubber pads on each foot of the strumbar. These can be lifted straight out of their slots.

    <img
      src="/images/rgbstrumbar3.png"
      alt="Rgbstrumbar3"
      title="Rgbstrumbar3"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"36%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Make sure you have all the stock parts you need:

    - 1x Metal strumrod
    - 2x Circular spacers
    - 4x Rubber pads

    <img
      src="/images/rgbstrumbar4.png"
      alt="Rgbstrumbar4"
      title="Rgbstrumbar4"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"41%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Find the white tube of lubricant and apply a very small amount on each end of the metal strumrod, where it makes contacts with the circular spacers. Use for finger or a qtip to spread the lubricant out; we want only a thin layer of lubricant on the ends of the strumrod!

    <img
      src="/images/rgbstrumbar5.png"
      alt="Rgbstrumbar5"
      title="Rgbstrumbar5"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"55%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Put all of these parts into the new strumbar, in the same places as the stock strumbar. Insert the rubber pads into the slots in each of the feet of the new strumbar, insert the spacers into the circular cutouts on each end of the new strumbar, then insert the metal strumrod through the spacers.

    <img
      src="/images/rgbstrumbar6.png"
      alt="Rgbstrumbar6"
      title="Rgbstrumbar6"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"49%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    If the strumbar slides up and down the metal rod too much for your liking, then you can install the wide, thin spacers included on the end of the component piece to fill in the gap. Place these under the stock strumbar spacers. You may need to stack multiple on each end to get your desired tolerance!

    <img
      src="/images/rgbstrumbar7.png"
      alt="Rgbstrumbar7"
      title="Rgbstrumbar7"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"51%" }}
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Installing the Revival Zeroboard (strumboard)

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pjt6d5tVTfM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen />

k

<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    Slide the metal rod into the new strumbar. Then place the new strumbar into the slot that the stock strumbar sat in. Put the black brackets back into place.

    <img
      src="/images/revzbinstall1.png"
      alt="Revzbinstall1"
      title="Revzbinstall1"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"62%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Separate the small strum keycaps from the component piece and slot them into the stems of the strum switches. This is needed for a tighter strumbar feel.

    <img
      src="/images/revzbinstall2.png"
      alt="Revzbinstall2"
      title="Revzbinstall2"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"65%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Place the new strumboard on top of the black brackets, then screw in the new strumboard. If the stock screws are stripped, you can use the replacement Long Screws provided in the kit. Make sure each screw is snug, but do not over-tighten them, or you may scratch away the soldermask of the new strumboard!

    <img
      src="/images/revzbinstall3.png"
      alt="Revzbinstall3"
      title="Revzbinstall3"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"64%" }}
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Installing the Revival Fretboard

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onVrWBbpTLA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen />

<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    Gather the Revival Kit Fretboard, Translucent Frets, 3 White Wires, and 2 Long Screws.
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Connect one end of each of the White Wires into the RGB, FRET1, and FRET2 connectors on the Fretboard. Connect the other end of each White Wire to the corresponding RGB, FRET1, and FRET2 connectors on the Strumboard. I recommend doing one wire at a time to prevent mixing them up.
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Remove the stock silicone pad and frets if they are still in the fret slots. Wipe the inside of the fret slots clean if they are dirty. Then apply a small amount of lubricant to your finger or a qtip and lightly coat the inside of the fret slots with lubricant. Make sure to wipe away any excess lubricant that my have spilled to the front of the neck shell!

    <img
      src="/images/cleanfrets.png"
      alt="Cleanfrets"
      title="Cleanfrets"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"58%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Insert the **translucent 3D printed frets** provided in the kit. These frets **must** be used even if you do not want to use LEDs; the stock frets will **not** fit with the new Fretboard.\
    Model **95065** Xplorers will need to use the included fret shims to fit properly. Other models will not need shims.

    <img
      src="/images/clearfrets.png"
      alt="Clearfrets"
      title="Clearfrets"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"47%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Place the new Fretboard onto the screw standoffs that the stock fretboard used to sit on (the red switches and white connectors should be facing down towards the Translucent Frets. Use 2 Long Screws to secure the new Fretboard.

    <img
      src="/images/fretboardinstall.png"
      alt="Fretboardinstall"
      title="Fretboardinstall"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"68%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Route the White Wires through the neck and down through the body. Make sure they are clear of any screw standoffs so they are not damaged when reinstalling the neck shell. Using a bit of tape to hold down the wires internally can help with management.

    <img
      src="/images/cablemanage.png"

<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    Gather the Xplorer Breakout board (labelled 1X) and 4 Long Screws. Stock screws can also be used if they are not stripped
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Make sure the rubber dome pads are still in place, then install the Xplorer Breakout board where the stock input board used to sit. Use the stock screws or included Long Screws to secure it.

    <img
      src="/images/breakout1.png"

      title="Breakout1"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"60%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Connect three red wires into the three white connectors on the Xplorer Breakout board.

    <img

      alt="Breakout2"
      title="Breakout2"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"56%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Connect the other ends of the red wires into their matching connectors on the Zeroboard. Double check the labels on each board and make sure the wires are going to matching connectors!

    <img

You’re almost done! Once you have ensured that each input works, we can close up the guitar!

Make sure none of the wires are in the way of any plastic standoffs, as this will damage them when closing the shell. I would recommend taping down the wires to ensure they are out of the way and not draped across any of the boards.

With the front body and neck shell facing down, put the rear neck shell onto the front neck shell. You may need to apply pressure to close the shell. If you feel like part of the shell will not snap into place, open it up and double check that there is nothing blocking the standoffs. Repeat for the body shell.

**DON’T FORGET THE STRAP PEGS!**

After both sides of the body are connected, install all of the screws you removed earlier:
