# IMPORTANT NOTE:

The RCM 360 Wireless Receiver features a dual-preset switch that allows you to change between instrument types. By default, mode “A” is set to GH Guitar and mode “B” is set to RB Drums.\
If you ever want to switch between the two, make sure that the controller you were using first is OFF. Most Xbox 360 controllers cannot be turned off manually without removing the batteries. Once you’ve done that, resync the receiver and connect the other controller.

      <Step>
        <Card img="/images/DrumTuning2.png">
          Refer to the picture above. Value shows the signal sent from your drums to the ACE Adapter. Hit the pads to see the bar move and number go up! There are two modifiers you can change, Threshold and Sensitivity.

          - Threshold is how hard you have to hit before the game detects an input. Raising this requires you to hit harder. You want to change this if your light hit starts at a high number.
          - Sensitivity defines the max range of detection. It determines the loudness or hardness of the hit that the game detects. Lowering this allows hits with less strength to hit louder. You want to change this if your hard hits do not get close to maxing out the Value meter.
        </Card>
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Some pads are more sensitive than others, so we suggest going through each pad/cymbal/input and adjusting to your liking.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Once you’re satisfied with calibration, click “Save Settings” on the left side of the window. Once the programming tool has finished writing the firmware, it will show “Status: Done” and 100%. Close the software.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My RCM 360 Wireless Receiver is not appearing in the RCM Programming Tool">
    There are multiple potential reasons for this occurring.

    - The instrument plugged into your RCM 360 Wireless Receiver may be causing the adapter to go into a different mode. Unplug the instrument, then plug the RCM 360 Wireless Receiver back into your computer on its own.
    - Faulty USB port. Try a different one.
    - Lastly, you may just need to hard reset the device. Holding the reset button while plugging the adapter in will put it into recovery mode, which you can then open the [RCM Programming Tool](https://retrocultmods.com/programming-tool/) and erase and reset to factory.

    If you continue to run into issues, send us an email at [support@retrocultmods.com](mailto:support@retrocultmods.com)
