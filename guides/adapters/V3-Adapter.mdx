## Tuning and Calibration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion description="*You will ONLY need to do this with USB guitars. Wiimote Nunchuk connected guitars rely on the V3’s internal tilt sensors." title="Tilt Calibration/Tuning">
    Click here for a step-by-step Tilt Tuning guide.

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        First, we must open the USB Host Inputs dropdown menu in the RCM Programing Tool.

        <Frame>
          ![Usbhostinputs](/images/Programmer/usbhostinputs.png)
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Scroll down to the guitar tilt section and click the empty space or the dropdown arrow. This menu will appear:

        <Frame>
          ![Tiltcalibration](/images/Programmer/tiltcalibration.png)
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Click Calibrate!
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Then, position your guitar in the position you play in. Click Next.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        After that, tilt your guitar up to the position you would like tilt to activate. Hold it there and click next.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Once you’re satisfied with calibration, click “Save Settings” on the left side of the window. Once the programming tool has finished writing the firmware, it will show “Status: Done” and 100%. Close the software.

        <Frame>
          ![Program Done](/images/Programmer/ProgramDone.png)

      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Whammy Calibration/Tuning">
    <Steps>
      <Step>
        First, we must open the Wii Extensions Inputs or USB Host Inputs dropdown menu.

        <Frame>
          ![V3inputsfound](/images/V3-Adapter/v3inputsfound.png)
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Scroll down to the guitar whammy section. You’ll see this:

      </Step>
      <Step>
        Click Calibrate!
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Then, don’t touch your whammy bar and then click Next.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        After that, push your whammy bar down as far as it can go without overdoing it. Hold it there, then click Next.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Now you have to set Deadzone. Push the whammy bar in a little bit and you can see the value go up a little bit. Look for a point where the whammy won’t activate on it’s own. Hold it there, then click Next.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        You’re done! Click Save Settings on the left side and wait for the status bar at the bottom of the window to reach 100%.

        <Frame>
          ![Program Done](/images/Programmer/ProgramDone.png)

  <Accordion title="Drum Tuning">
    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Before even attempting to calibrate the V3 Adapter for Drums, make sure you’re on the preset for your controller. [Click here to be taken to the programming section.](https://retrocultmods.mintlify.app/guides/adapters/ace-adapter#programming) You can find out what preset you’re on in the main menu of the programming tool.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Plug in your controller or electronic drum kit.

        - If you are using USB-MIDI, you should see “1 Devices connected” next to USB Host Inputs.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Click the MIDI Inputs dropdown, then start tapping on your drums while looking through the inputs to find if they are appearing. It may be useful to write down the MIDI note value for each of your pads/cymbals for easy future reference.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <Card img="/images/Programmer/Drums/DrumTuning2.png">
          Refer to the picture above. Value shows the signal sent from your drums to the ACE Adapter. Hit the pads to see the bar move and number go up! There are two modifiers you can change, Threshold and Sensitivity.

          - Threshold is how hard you have to hit before the game detects an input. Raising this requires you to hit harder. You want to change this if your light hit starts at a high number.
          - Sensitivity defines the max range of detection. It determines the loudness or hardness of the hit that the game detects. Lowering this allows hits with less strength to hit louder. You want to change this if your hard hits do not get close to maxing out the Value meter.
        </Card>
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Some pads are more sensitive than others, so we suggest going through each pad/cymbal/input and adjusting to your liking.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Once you’re satisfied with calibration, click “Save Settings” on the left side of the window. Once the programming tool has finished writing the firmware, it will show “Status: Done” and 100%. Close the software.

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Before even attempting to calibrate the V3 Adapter for Gamepads, make sure you’re on the preset for your controller. [Click here to be taken to the programming section.](https://retrocultmods.mintlify.app/guides/adapters/ace-adapter#programming) You can find out what preset you’re on in the main menu of the programming tool.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Plug in your gamepad. You should see “**1 Devices connected**” appear next to either USB Host Inputs or Wii Extension Input, depending on what type of gamepad you plugged in.

          />
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Click the dropdown with whichever type of input you plugged in, then scroll to the thumbsticks. There should only be four inputs. X and Y axis for both thumbsticks.

          />
        </Frame>
        If you are using a Wii Classic Controller, you will see this instead:

        <Frame>
          <img
            src="/images/V3-Adapter/wiithumbstick.png"
            alt="Wiithumbstick"
            title="Wiithumbstick"
            className="mx-auto"
            style={{ width:"96%" }}
          />
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Move both stick around and see the values that they idle at once you release. Adjust the deadzone to be a bit higher than the idling number. Once you set this, click **Save Settings** on the left side of the window. You can also use the Calibrate feature, which you then just need to follow the steps of.

          <img

            alt="Deadzonethumbsticks"
            title="Deadzonethumbsticks"
            className="mx-auto"
            style={{ width:"96%" }}
          />
        </Frame>
        Optionally, you can set deadzones for triggers if those are experiencing any erratic change in idle value.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Once you’re satisfied with calibration, click “Save Settings” on the left side of the window. Once the programming tool has finished writing the firmware, it will show “Status: Done” and 100%. Close the software.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="sparkles" title="My V3 Adapter is not appearing in the RCM Programming Tool">
    There are multiple potential reasons for this occurring.

    - The instrument plugged into your V3 Adapter may be causing the adapter to go into a different mode. Unplug the instrument, then plug the V3 adapter back into your computer.
    - Faulty USB cable or USB port. Using the same cable, try a different port, then switch the cable.
    - Lastly, you may just need to hard reset the device. Holding the reset button (small button inside pinhole on the front of the V3 Adapter) while plugging the adapter in will put it into recovery mode, which you can then open the [RCM Programming Tool](https://retrocultmods.com/programming-tool/) and erase and reset to factory.
