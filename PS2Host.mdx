    </Step>
    <Step>
      You will be brought to this screen in the Programming Tool

      If you are attempting to change to a different preset, click the dropdown on the left side, then select that preset. After, click “Save Settings“.
    </Step>

## Tuning and Calibration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Whammy Calibration/Tuning">
    1. Open the USB Host Inputs dropdown menu.

       <img
         src="/images/image-3.png"
         alt="Image"
         title="Image"
         className="mx-auto"
         style={{ width:"50%" }}
       />
    2. Scroll down to the guitar whammy section. You’ll see this:

       <img
         src="/images/image-4.png"
         alt="Image"
         title="Image"
         className="mx-auto"
         style={{ width:"88%" }}
       />
    3. Click Calibrate!
    4. Then, don’t touch your whammy bar and then click Next.
    5. After that, push your whammy bar down as far as it can go without overdoing it. Hold it there, then click Next.
    6. Now you have to set Deadzone. Push the whammy bar in a little bit and you can see the value go up a little bit. Look for a point where the whammy won’t activate on it’s own. Hold it there, then click Next.
    7. You’re done! Click Save Settings on the left side. After it’s done, give it a try! You can manually adjust the deadzone with the sliders as well if you’d like to tweak your settings.

       <img
         src="/images/image-5.png"
         alt="Image"
         title="Image"
         className="mx-auto"
         style={{ width:"98%" }}
       />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Gamepad Thumbstick Tuning">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="">
        Before even attempting to calibrate the V3 Adapter for Gamepads, make sure you’re on the preset for your controller. [Click here to be taken to the programming section.](https://retrocultmods.mintlify.app/guides/adapters/ace-adapter#programming) You can find out what preset you’re on in the main menu of the programming tool.
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
        Plug in your gamepad. You should see “**1 Devices connected**” appear next to either USB Host Inputs or Wii Extension Input, depending on what type of gamepad you plugged in.

        <img
          src="/images/image-1.png"
          alt="Image 1"
          title="Image 1"
          style={{ width:"35%" }}
        />
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
        Click the dropdown with whichever type of input you plugged in, then scroll to the thumbsticks. There should only be four inputs. X and Y axis for both thumbsticks.

        ![Thumbstickcalibration](/images/thumbstickcalibration.png)
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
        Move both stick around and see the values that they idle at once you release. Adjust the deadzone to be a bit higher than the idling number. Once you set this, click **Save Settings** on the left side of the window. You can also use the Calibrate feature, which you then just need to follow the steps of.

        ![Deadzonethumbsticks](/images/deadzonethumbsticks.png)

        Optionally, you can set deadzones for triggers if those are experiencing any erratic change in idle value.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My MiniHost Adapter is not appearing in the RCM Programming Tool">
    There are multiple potential reasons for this occurring.

    - The instrument plugged into your MiniHost Adapter may be causing the adapter to go into a different mode. Unplug the instrument, then plug the MiniHost adapter back into your computer on its own.
    - Faulty USB port. Try a different one.
    - Lastly, you may just need to hard reset the device. Holding the reset button while plugging the adapter in will put it into recovery mode, which you can then open the [RCM Programming Tool](https://retrocultmods.com/programming-tool/) and erase and reset to factory.

    If you continue to run into issues, send us an email at [support@retrocultmods.com](mailto:support@retrocultmods.com)
