### Programming

<Accordion title="V3 Adapter Programming Guide">
  To change the preset of your PS2-to-USB Adapter, you must use the RCM Programming Tool. Click here to be taken to the download page.

  <Steps>
    <Step>
      Open the RCM Programming Tool.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Plug your PS2-to-USB Adapter into your computer. **Make sure the mode switch is set to D.** You will see it appear with “Configure” and “Reset to factory” buttons.

      ![V3RCM Prog Home](/images/V3RCMProgHome.png)
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Click “Configure“
    </Step>
    <Step>
      You will be brought to this screen in the Programming Tool

      ![V3configure Screen](/images/V3ConfigureScreen.png)

      If you are attempting to change to a different preset, click the dropdown on the left side, then select that preset. After, click “Save Settings“.

        title="V3presets"
        className="mx-auto"
        style={{ width:"33%" }}
      />
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Wait until the bar at the bottom reaches 100% and says Status: Done.

      <img
        src="/images/ProgramDone.png"
        alt="Program Done"
        title="Program Done"
        className="mx-auto"
        style={{ width:"41%" }}
      />
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Accordion>

## Tuning and Calibration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Whammy Calibration/Tuning">
    1. First, we must open the Wii Extensions Inputs or USB Host Inputs dropdown menu.

       <img
         src="/images/image-2.png"
         alt="Image"
         title="Image"
         className="mx-auto"
         style={{ width:"50%" }}
       />

       <img
         src="/images/image-3.png"
         alt="Image"
         title="Image"
         className="mx-auto"
         style={{ width:"50%" }}
       />
    2. Scroll down to the guitar whammy section. You’ll see this:

       <img
         src="/images/image-4.png"
         alt="Image"
         title="Image"
         className="mx-auto"
         style={{ width:"88%" }}
       />
    3. Click Calibrate!
    4. Then, don’t touch your whammy bar and then click Next.
    5. After that, push your whammy bar down as far as it can go without overdoing it. Hold it there, then click Next.
    6. Now you have to set Deadzone. Push the whammy bar in a little bit and you can see the value go up a little bit. Look for a point where the whammy won’t activate on it’s own. Hold it there, then click Next.
    7. You’re done! Click Save Settings on the left side. After it’s done, give it a try! You can manually adjust the deadzone with the sliders as well if you’d like to tweak your settings.

       <img
         src="/images/image-5.png"
         alt="Image"
         title="Image"
         className="mx-auto"
         style={{ width:"98%" }}
       />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Drum Tuning">
    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Before even attempting to calibrate the V3 Adapter for Drums, make sure you’re on the preset for your controller. [Click here to be taken to the programming section.](https://retrocultmods.mintlify.app/guides/adapters/ace-adapter#programming) You can find out what preset you’re on in the main menu of the programming tool.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Plug in your controller or electronic drum kit.

        - If you are using USB-MIDI, you should see “1 Devices connected” next to USB Host Inputs.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Click the MIDI Inputs dropdown, then start tapping on your drums while looking through the inputs to find if they are appearing. It may be useful to write down the MIDI note value for each of your pads/cymbals for easy future referd Tence.

        <img
          src="/images/Screenshot 2026-02-02 at 8.10.24 PM.png"
          alt="Screenshot 2026 02 02 At 8 10 24 PM"
          title="Screenshot 2026 02 02 At 8 10 24 PM"
          style={{ width:"46%" }}
        />
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <Card img="/images/DrumTuning2.png">
          Refer to the picture above. Value shows the signal sent from your drums to the ACE Adapter. Hit the pads to see the bar move and number go up! There are two modifiers you can change, Threshold and Sensitivity.

          - Threshold is how hard you have to hit before the game detects an input. Raising this requires you to hit harder. You want to change this if your light hit starts at a high number.
          - Sensitivity defines the max range of detection. It determines the loudness or hardness of the hit that the game detects. Lowering this allows hits with less strength to hit louder. You want to change this if your hard hits do not get close to maxing out the Value meter.
        </Card>
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Some pads are more sensitive than others, so we suggest going through each pad/cymbal/input and adjusting to your liking.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Once you’re satisfied with calibration, click “Save Settings” on the left side of the window. Once the programming tool has finished writing the firmware, it will show “Status: Done” and 100%. Close the software.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Load up your favorite game and play! Or plug into your console and play!

        - If you are attempting to play Rock Band 4 on Xbox One/Series, you will have to authenticate. Click here to learn how to do that!
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Gamepad Thumbstick Tuning">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="">
        Before even attempting to calibrate the V3 Adapter for Gamepads, make sure you’re on the preset for your controller. [Click here to be taken to the programming section.](https://retrocultmods.mintlify.app/guides/adapters/ace-adapter#programming) You can find out what preset you’re on in the main menu of the programming tool.
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
        Plug in your gamepad. You should see “**1 Devices connected**” appear next to either USB Host Inputs or Wii Extension Input, depending on what type of gamepad you plugged in.

        <img
          src="/images/v3inputsfound-1.png"
          alt="V3inputsfound 1"
          title="V3inputsfound 1"
          style={{ width:"51%" }}
        />
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
        Click the dropdown with whichever type of input you plugged in, then scroll to the thumbsticks. There should only be four inputs. X and Y axis for both thumbsticks.

        ![Thumbstickcalibration](/images/thumbstickcalibration.png)

        If you are using a Wii Classic Controller, you will see this instead:

        ![Wiithumbstick](/images/wiithumbstick.png)
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
        Move both stick around and see the values that they idle at once you release. Adjust the deadzone to be a bit higher than the idling number. Once you set this, click **Save Settings** on the left side of the window. You can also use the Calibrate feature, which you then just need to follow the steps of.

        ![Deadzonethumbsticks](/images/deadzonethumbsticks.png)

        Optionally, you can set deadzones for triggers if those are experiencing any erratic change in idle value.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My PS2-to-USB Adapter is not appearing in the RCM Programming Tool">
    There are multiple potential reasons for this occurring.

    - Your PS2-to-USB Adapter may be in the wrong mode, set the switch to D.
    - The instrument plugged into your PS2-to-USB Adapter may be causing the adapter to go into a different mode. Unplug the instrument, then plug the PS2-to-USB Adapter back into your computer.
    - Faulty USB cable or USB port. Using the same cable, try a different port, then switch the cable.
    - Lastly, you may just need to hard reset the device. Holding the reset button (The "U" shaped button on your PS2-to-USB Adapter) while plugging the adapter in will put it into recovery mode, which you can then open the [RCM Programming Tool](https://retrocultmods.com/programming-tool/) and erase and reset to factory.
